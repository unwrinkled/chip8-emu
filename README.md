# CHIP-8 Emulator

My take on the emulation of programs written in the CHIP-8 interpreted language for COSMAC VIP systems.

## Usage

You will need to find some CHIP-8 roms on the internet. Then just run:

```pwsh
./build/bin/Release/chip8.exe ROM_Path
```

## Installation

### Requirements

 You will need to download and install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
